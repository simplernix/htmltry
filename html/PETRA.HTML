<img src="i/petra.jpg" class="sticky">
<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top:-17%; margin-right:10%" align="justify">Petra, Arabic Baṭrā, ancient city, centre of an Arab kingdom in Hellenistic and Roman times, the ruins of which are in southwest Jordan. The city was built on a terrace, pierced from east to west by the Wadi Mūsā (the Valley of Moses)—one of the places where, according to tradition, the Israelite leader Moses struck a rock and water gushed forth. The valley is enclosed by sandstone cliffs veined with shades of red and purple varying to pale yellow, and for this reason Petra was called by the 19th-century English biblical scholar John William Burgon a “rose-red city half as old as Time.” The modern town of Wadi Mūsā, situated adjacent to the ancient city, chiefly serves the steady stream of tourists who continue to visit the site.</p>
<h3 align="center">WHERE IS PETRA?</h3>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">Petra is located about 150 miles south of both Jerusalem and Amman, the capital of Jordan, and about midway between Damascus, Syria, and the Red Sea, making it ideally suited as a hub of commerce in the area.
</p><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
The site is considered significant by historians and archeologists alike because of its beautiful rock-cut architecture and innovative water management system, the latter of which made the region inhabitable, given that it is surrounded by desert and rugged, mountainous terrain.
</p><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
Petra has also been referred to as the “Rose City” because of the color of the stones used in its buildings. It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.
</p>
<h3 align="center">CITY OF PETRA</h3>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">The city of Petra was established as a trading post by the Nabateans, an Arab Bedouin tribe indigenous to the region in what is now southwestern Jordan.
</p><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
The Nabateans living and trading in Petra soon accumulated a significant amount of wealth, and an envious Greek Empire attacked the city in 312 B.C. This event marks the first reference to Petra in recorded history.
</p><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
The Nabateans successfully fought back the Greek invaders by taking advantage of the mountainous terrain surrounding the city. The mountains effectively served as a natural wall, buttressing Petra.
</p><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
However, the Greek incursion was not the last time the city would come under attack.
In fact, the Romans would invade Petra in 106 A.D., and ultimately forced the Nabateans to surrender. The Roman Empire annexed the newly gained territory and changed its name to Arabia Petraea.
</p><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
They continued to rule over the city for more than 250 years until the middle of the fourth century A.D., when an earthquake destroyed many of its buildings. The Byzantines eventually took control of the region, and governed Petra for some 300 years.
</p>
<H3 align="center"> LOST CITY OF PETRA</H3>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
By the beginning of the eighth century A.D., Petra was largely abandoned and no longer a significant location commercially, politically and/or culturally.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
Although no longer an important city, Petra has been noted by historians and archeologists for its unique architecture as well as a specific innovation made by the Nabatean Bedouins that established the city.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
Given the rugged, mountainous terrain that surrounds it, Petra wouldn’t seem like a logical place to build a city. However, the Nabateans took advantage of this geography as they erected its key structures.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
Using an early form of the technique known as rock-cut architecture, the Nabateans literally carved several of the city’s buildings out of the surrounding stone surfaces. As the Nabatean culture evolved, and as the Romans and the Byzantines later sought to leave their own marks on the city, the architecture of Petra began to take on a mix of the different cultures that occupied it.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
Large and ornate tombs built by the Nabateans eventually gave way to Christian churches constructed by the Byzantines, who considered Petra the capital of the province of Palaestina.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
During this evolution, while the Romans ruled the city after the Nabateans and before the Byzantines, the Petra Roman Road was built. This served as the main thoroughfare of Petra, and ornate gates were built, in Roman style, to mark the entrance to the city.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;" align="justify">
However, the Nabateans’ influence over the city’s design and structure was not completely eliminated by its subsequent rulers.
